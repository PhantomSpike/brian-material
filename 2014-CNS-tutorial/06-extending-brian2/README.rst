This folder contains examples in the form of ipython notebooks (.ipynb files). More information on the ipython notebook can be found at the `ipython website <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ if you have a recent version of ipython, you also have the notebook, try starting it with::

    ipython notebook --pylab=inline


Alternatively, you can view (but not edit) the notebooks using the `ipython notebook viewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/>`_. To see the notebooks from this folder, use the following links:
